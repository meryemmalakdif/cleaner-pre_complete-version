# LinkToken V0.6

## Introduction
The Chainlink (LINK) token is the utility token of the Chainlink network, a decentralized oracle platform connecting smart contracts with real-world data.

## Why we integrate it ?

1.  **Utility**: LINK is used as payment within Chainlink's ecosystem to access oracle services that provide reliable external data to smart contracts.
    
2.  **Node Incentives**: Node operators are rewarded with LINK for retrieving and validating data, promoting a strong oracle network.
    
3.  **Smart Contract Payments**: Developers pay with LINK for oracle services to ensure accurate and tamper-proof data integration.
